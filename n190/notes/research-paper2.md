Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms the Earth's surface. This heat is radiated back toward space.

Most of the Outgoing heat is abosrbed by greenouse gas molecules and re-emited in all directions, warming the surface of the Eath and the lower atmosphere.

Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities, and most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position.

Ch. 3 - 3.10: Consequences of Climate Change
- **Greenhouse Gases**:
  - Water Vapor: The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.
  - Nitrous Oxide: A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.
  - Methane: A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.
  - Carbon Dioxide: A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.
- Choloroflourocarbons (CFCs)

**Evidence**
Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA.
- Global temperature rise
  - The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century
- Warming oceans
- Shrink ice sheets
  - The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 286 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 127 billion tons of ice per year during the same time period. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade
- Glacial retreat
- Decreased snow cover
- Sea level rise
- Declining Artic sea ice
**Causes**
- We live in a greenhouse
  - Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and then radiated upward in the form of infrared heat. About 90 percent of this heat is then absorbed by the greenhouse gases and radiated back toward the surface, which is warmed to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit
- Most climate scientists agree the main cause of the current global warming trend is human expansion of the "greenhouse effect"1 — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.
- Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as "feedbacks."

[Is global warming real?](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-real/)
- **Temperatures rising**
  - Evidence of rising temperatures is pervasive and striking: Thermometer records kept over the past century and a half show Earth's average temperature has risen more than 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius), and about twice that in parts of the Arctic.
  - This trend is part of climate change, which many people consider synonymous with global warming. Scientists prefer to use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems. **Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts**.
    - All of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
- **How is climate change measured?**
  - We do have other records that help us figure out what temperatures were like in the distant past. For example, trees store information about the climate in the place they’re rooted. Each year trees grow thicker and form new rings. In warmer and wetter years, the rings are thicker. Old trees and wood can tell us about conditions hundreds or even thousands of years ago.
  - Windows on the past are also buried in lakes and oceans. Pollen, particles, and dead creatures fall to the bottom of oceans and lakes each year, forming sediments. Sediments contain a wealth of information about what was in the air and water when they fell. **Scientists reveal this record by inserting hollow tubes into the mud to collect layers of sediment going back millions of years.**
  - For a direct look at the atmosphere of the past, scientists drill cores through the Earth's polar ice sheets. Tiny bubbles trapped in the ice are actually samples from the Earth's past atmosphere, frozen in time. That's how we know that the concentrations of greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution are higher than they've been for hundreds of thousands of years.
- **We are the reason**
  - Several factors affect how much of the sun's energy reaches Earth's surface and how much of that energy gets absorbed. **Those include greenhouse gases, particles in the atmosphere (from volcanic eruptions, for example), and changes in energy coming from the sun itself.**
  - The answer to the question, “Is global warming real?” is yes: Nothing other than the rapid rise of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity can fully explain the dramatic and relatively recent rise in global average temperatures

[Scientists say 25 years left to fight climate change](https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-09-13/scientists-say-25-years-left-fight-climate-change)
- **Anthropogenic**, or human-caused, warming has been stoked by increasing amounts of heat-trapping pollution since the start of the industrial age more than 200 years ago
- Across the US the average temperature has risen almost two degrees Fahrenheit since the start of the 20th century. And that’s only the beginning, says Bill Collin, who directs climate and ecological science at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
- Despite the pledges made in Paris by nearly every nation in the world (the US under the Trump administration is alone among signatories in backing out of the climate accord), emissions are still rising. And even those historic commitments — if they’re all kept — won’t be enough to turn things around.
- In the space of a little over 230 years since the start of industrialization, Collins says "our steam engines, our factories, our cars … they've taken us back five million years."
- And Collins says we have about 25 years — roughly one generation — to reverse course.
- Collins and Fung both have their glimmers of optimism that technology and the boom in solar, wind and other forms of clean energy could quickly reduce climate emissions. Fung also points to the young college students passing by us on the Berkeley campus as her best hope.

[Effects of global warming](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-effects/)
- The signs of global warming are everywhere, and are more complex than just climbing temperatures.
- Since 1906, the global average surface temperature has increased by more than 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius)—even more in sensitive polar regions
  - The heat is melting glaciers and sea ice, shifting precipitation patterns, and setting animals on the move.
- Many people think of global warming and climate change as synonyms, but scientists prefer to use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems.
  - Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts.
  - All of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.

[Can We Reverse Global Warming By Turning Carbon Dioxide Back Into Coal?](https://www.dogonews.com/2019/3/7/can-we-reverse-global-warming-by-turning-carbon-dioxide-back-into-coal)
- Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas and is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse effect, responsible for global warming
- Researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia beleve they  have found a feasible way to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide turning the gas back into coal
- The metal catalysts - compounds that accelerate the chemical reactions - used to convert the gas into solid carbon only work at temperatures above 1,112 degrees F.
  - In addition to being expensive, the high amount of energy needed for the conversion defeats the purpose of the exercise altogether. Additionally, the catalysts also tend to quickly clog from the carbon deposits, making them ineffective for long-term use.​​​​
- To find a viable solution, the RMIT researchers began by creating a liquid catalyst - a mix of gallium, indium, and tin. To speed up the alloy's chemical reaction, the mixture was infused with catalytically-active cerium. The scientists than piped pure CO2 into the glass tube and zapped it with a jolt of electricity. The combination of the cerium and energy converted the gas into solid carbon, releasing only pure oxygen
- Additionally, the carbon flakes float away and settle along the sides and bottom of the liquid metal, leaving the cerium clog-free to continue its work. While the researchers, who published their findings in the journal Nature Communications on February 26, 2019, are not sure how the conversion happens, they suspect it's a multi-stage process, which involves the cerium reacting with oxygen, CO2, and water.
- Whether the laboratory experiment can be replicated on a scale large enough to make a difference to our environment remains to be seen
- The researcher says, “By using liquid metals as a catalyst, we’ve shown it’s possible to turn the gas back into carbon at room temperature, in a process that’s efficient and scalable. While more research needs to be done, it’s a crucial first step to delivering solid storage of carbon.”

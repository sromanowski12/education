### **[What Are the Most Dangerous Threats to Air Quality?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-are-the-most-dangerous-threats-to-air-quality/)**
- Scientific American

**Main Question**:

_What are some of the more dangerous threats to our air quality and what can be done to eliminate them so we can all breathe more easily?_

**A**: Main threats to local air quality are smog and particulate pollution


- The American Lung Association (ALA) reports that almost half of all Americans live in counties where air pollution routinely reaches unhealthy levels and can therefore make people sick or exacerbate pre-existing health conditions.
- **Sources - Poor Air Quality**:
  - Mobile Sources - (trains, smokestacks, and automobiles)
  - “When these gases come in contact with sunlight, they react and form ozone smog.” Breathing in smog, while inevitable in certain urban and industrial areas, can irritate the cardiovascular system and cause other health problems.

- **Sources - Particulate Matter**
  - “Burning fossil fuels in factories, power plants, steel mills, smelters, diesel- and gasoline-powered motor vehicles (cars and trucks) and equipment generates a large part of the raw material for fine particles,” explains ALA... 
  - “So does burning wood in residential fireplaces and wood stoves or burning agricultural fields or forests.”
  - Chronic exposure to particulate pollution has been linked not only to cardiovascular issues but also to cancers and reproductive problems—and has been shown to contribute to premature death.

Worldwide, air pollution lowers average life spans by a year. In more polluted parts of Asia and Africa, dirty air shortens lives up to twice that much. Scientists shared their new findings August 22 in Environmental Science & Technology Letters.

It was the first major country-by-country look at the link between life spans and what’s known as fine PM (PM is short for particulate matter)

Air pollution has been linked to many health problems. Among them are lung and heart diseases. Most earlier studies had looked at how tiny air pollutants affected rates of illness or death.

Joshua Apte. He’s an environmental scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. By instead looking at life expectancy, his team had hoped to make the threat easier to understand.

PM2.5 is what scientists call tiny particles of pollution in the air. Higher levels of PM2.5 can cause health problems and cut months, if not years, from the average life span. This analysis, based on 2016 data, shows how pollution affects life expectancy in different parts of the world. Each dot represents a country.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting PM2.5 to 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air. Apte’s group calculated how holding pollution to this low level would help people. Some high-income countries, including Canada, already keep their air this clean. But others, typically in fairly poor countries, have far higher pollution levels.

But meeting the WHO standard won’t eliminate health costs from dirty air. That’s because even below 10 micrograms per cubic meter, pollution still causes significant risks.

India is has some of the world’s worst air pollution. There, clearing the air to WHO standards would up the chances by 20 percent that a 60-year-old person would live another 25 years, the authors say.

Reducing air pollution could increase life expectancy. This map shows what would happen if every country limited fine particles in the air to 10 micrograms per cubic meter. That’s the limit the World Health Organization recommends. In countries with very dirty air, that change would lengthen people’s lives. In countries whose air already meets this standard, the map shows no gain in life expectancy. That’s because even very low levels of pollution can still harm health.

The scientists also compared how other threats shorten life spans across the globe. These risk factors included smoking and cancer. In South Asia (which includes India, for example), they found PM2.5 had a bigger effect on life expectancy than did all cancers combined

These results show that in poor countries, cleaning up dirty air could greatly boost life spans. It could have as big an effect as cleaning up drinking water, or curing breast cancer or lung cancer. In wealthier countries, the opposite is true. Air pollution shortens life expectancy in these countries by less than half a year. But all forms of cancer shorten the average life in wealthier countries by more than 3.5 years.

Knowing this “can really help people, or policy makers, decide where to spend their money,” says Kirk Smith. He studies global environmental health at the University of California, Berkeley. Smith was not involved in the study.

Fine particulate air pollution, or PM2.5, is just one of many common health risks. But in some places, this pollution shortens people’s lives by more than other problems like lung cancer or poor water quality. 

In 42 countries — mostly in Africa and Asia —  PM2.5 shortened life spans by a year or more. Imagine having an extra year with the people in your life who matter most. Clearly, Apte says, “Everybody benefits when the air is improved.”

### **Book Notes**

Air pollution is everywhere, it’s unavoidable, and is caused by a variety of factors. A few of which include the following gases, carbon monoxide (CO), ozone ($O_3$), sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$), and nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$). As well as Particulate matter ($PM$). The impact they have on your health varies from dizziness and chest pains to much more serve depending on the amount of exposure. The primary sources of CO are automobiles and charcoal grills while $(SO_2)$ and $(NO_2)$ may be caused by vehicle engines, coal-fired power plants and coal-fired stoves. PM has many sources including vehicle engines, coal-burning power plants, wildfires, and blowing dust. (Anderson et al.)

**pg. 22 - 23**
Ozone (O3) has a sharp odor that you may have detected around electric motors or welding equipment. Even at very low concentrations, ozone can reduce your lung function. The symptoms you experience may include chest pain, coughing, sneezing, or lung congestion. Ozone also mottles the leaves of crops and yellows pine needles (Figure 1.6). Here on the surface of the Earth, ozone is definitely a bad actor. At high altitudes, however, it plays an essential role in screening out ultraviolet radiation

Sulfur dioxide (SO2) has a sharp, unpleasant odor. If you inhale sulfur dioxide, it dissolves in the moist tissue of your lungs to form an acid. The elderly, the young, and individuals with emphysema or asthma are most susceptible to sulfur dioxide poisoning. At present, sulfur dioxide in the air comes primarily from the burning of coal. For example, the 1952 London smog that eventually killed over 10,000 people was in part caused by the emissions of coal-fired stoves. The causes of death included acute respiratory distress, heart failure (from preexisting conditions), and asphyxiation. Some who survived had permanent lung damage.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has a characteristic brown color. Like sulfur dioxide, it can combine with the moist tissue in your lungs to produce an acid. In our atmosphere, nitrogen dioxide is produced from nitrogen monoxide, another pollutant that is a colorless gas. Nitrogen monoxide is formed in the air from anything that is hot, including vehicle engines and coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides, NO and NO2, also can form naturally in grain silos, and can injure or kill farmers who may inadvertently inhale the gases.

Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of tiny solid particles and microscopic liquid droplets and is the least understood of the air pollutants that we have listed. Particulate matter is classified by size rather than composition, because the size determines the health consequences. PM10 includes particles with an average diameter of 10 μm or less, a length on the order of 0.0004 inches. PM2.5 is a subset of PM10 and includes particles with an average diameter of less than 2.5 μm. These tinier and more deadly particles are sometimes called fine particles. Particulate matter originates from many sources, including vehicle engines, coal-burning power plants, wildfires, and blowing dust. Sometimes particulate matter is visible as soot or smoke (Figure 1.7). However, of more concern are the particles too tiny to see: PM10 and PM2.5. These particles, when inhaled, go deep into your lungs, irritating them. The smallest particles pass from your lungs into your bloodstream and can cause heart disease.

# **Ch. 2: Protecting the Ozone Layer**
- **Precautionary Principle**: stresses the wisdom of acting, even in the absence of complete scientific data, before the adverse effects on human health or the environment become significant or irrevocable
## **Ozone: What and Where Is It**
- The stratosphere is where ozone does most of its filtering of some types of ultraviolet light from the Sun
- **Ozone Layer**: a designated region in the stratosphere of maximum ozone concentration
- Ozone shield protects the surface of the Earth and its inhabitants from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation.
- The process by which ozone protects us from damaging solar radiation involves the interaction of matter and energy from the Sun
## **Atomic Structures and Periodicity**
- **Nucleus**: minuscule and highly dense center of an atom composed of protons and neutrons
- **Proton**: positively charged particles
- **Neutron**: electrically neutral particles
-  The protons and neutrons in the nucleus account for almost all the mass of an atom.
- **Electron**: has a mass much smaller than that of a proton or neutron and a negative electric charge
- The number of protons in the nucleus determines the identity of the atom
- **Atomic Number**: refers to the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom
- The periodic table also has elements arranged so that those with similar chemical properties fall in the same column (group)
- We know that the chemical properties of elements are the consequence of the distribution of electrons in the atoms of these elements. When chemical properties repeat themselves, this signals a repeat in electronic arrangement. As we will see, the electrons farthest from the nucleus are the main determinant of chemical properties.
- The electrons in the innermost level are the most strongly attracted by the positively charged protons in the nucleus. The greater the distance between an electron and the nucleus, the weaker the attraction between them. We say that the more distant electron is in a higher energy level, which means that the electron itself possesses more potential energy.
- **Outer (Valence) Electrons**: found in the highest energy level and help to account for many of the observed trends in chemical properties
- Observe that the group designation (1A, 2A, etc.) corresponds to the number of outer electrons for the A group elements, one of the most useful organizing features of the periodic table.
- In the families (another name for groups) of elements marked “A,” the number that heads the column indicates the number of outer electrons in each atom
- Alkali metals (Group 1A)—highly reactive metals with one outer electron
- Alkaline earth metals (Group 2A)—reactive metals with two outer electrons
- Halogens (Group 7A)—reactive nonmetals with 7 outer electrons
- Noble gases (Group 8A)—unreactive nonmetals with 8 outer electrons
- **Isotopes**: two or more forms of the same element (same number of protons) whose atoms differ in number of neutrons, and hence in mass
- **Mass Number**: the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom
## **Molecules & Models**
- **Covalent Bond**: refers to two electrons that are shared. Covalent implies "shared strength"
- **Lewis Structure**: a representation of an atom or molecule that shows its outer electrons
- **Single Covalent Bond**: when two electrons (one pair) are shared between two atoms
- **Structural Formula**: representation of how the atoms in a molecule are connected.
- **Octet Rule**: The fact that electrons in many molecules are arranged so that every atom (except hydrogen) shares in eight electrons
- **Double Bond**: a covalent bond consisting of two pairs of shared electrons
- **Triple Bond**: a covalent linkage made up of three pairs of shared electrons
## **Waves of Light**
- **Wavelength**: the distance between sucessive peaks
  - Suggests that light behaves something like a wave in a body of water
- **Frequency**: the number of waves passing a fixed point in 1 second
  - frequency (*v*) = speed of light (c) / wavelength ($\lambda$)
- **Electromagnetic Spectrum**: a continuum of waves that ranges from short, high-energy X-rays to long, low-energy radio waves
- **Radiant Energy**: the entire collection of different wavelengths, each with its own energy

53% of the total energy emitted by the Sun is radiated to Earth as infrared radiation. This is the major source of heat for the planet. Approximately 39% of the energy comes to us as visible light and only about 8% as ultraviolet. (The areas under the curve give an indication of these percentages.) But in spite of its small percentage, the Sun's UV radiation can be the most damaging to living things.

- **Infrared (IR)**: longest of the visible spectrum, heat ray absorptions cause molecules to bend and stretch
- **Microwaves**: cause molecules to rotate
- 
## **Radiation and Matter**
- **Photons**: "particles of light"
  - Albert Einstein (1879–1955), in the work that won him the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics, suggested that radiation itself should be viewed as constituted of individual bundles of energy
- Energy (E) = hc/($\lambda$)
  - E: energy of a single photon
  - h: Planck's constant
  - c: speed of light
    - h & c are constants
  - *This equation shows that energy, E, is inversely proprtional to the wavelength, v*. As the wavelength of radiation gets shorter, its energy increases.

The Sun bombards Earth with countless photons—indivisible packages of energy. The atmosphere, the planet's surface, and Earth's living things all absorb these photons.

Photons associated with different wavelengths are absorbed, and the energy is used to “excite” electrons in biological molecules. Some electrons jump to higher energy levels, triggering a series of complex chemical reactions that ultimately lead to sight

- **Photosynthesis**: the process through which green plants (including algae) and some bacteria capture the energy of sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. 

As the wavelength of light decreases, the energy carried by each photon increases. Photons in the UV region of the spectrum are sufficiently energetic to displace electrons from neutral molecules, converting them into positively charged species

Even shorter UV wavelength photons break bonds, causing molecules to come apart. In living things, such changes disrupt cells and create the potential for genetic defects and cancer

Ultraviolet radiation is able to break some, but not all, chemical bonds

Bonds are represented as springs that hold the atoms together but allow the atoms to move relative to each other.

### **Types of UV Radiation**
- **UV-A**: least damaging and reaches the Earth's surface in greatest amount
- **UV-B**: more damaging than UV-A but less damaging than UV-C.
  - Most of UV-B is absorbed by $O_3$ in the stratosphere
- **UV-C**: Most damaging but not a problem because it is completely absorbed by $O_2$ and $O_3$ in the stratosphere

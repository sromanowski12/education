# **Ch. 2: Protecting the Ozone Layer**
- **Precautionary Principle**: stresses the wisdom of acting, even in the absence of complete scientific data, before the adverse effects on human health or the environment become significant or irrevocable
## **Ozone: What and Where Is It**
- The stratosphere is where ozone does most of its filtering of some types of ultraviolet light from the Sun
- **Ozone Layer**: a designated region in the stratosphere of maximum ozone concentration
- Ozone shield protects the surface of the Earth and its inhabitants from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation.
- The process by which ozone protects us from damaging solar radiation involves the interaction of matter and energy from the Sun
## **Atomic Structures and Periodicity**
- **Nucleus**: minuscule and highly dense center of an atom composed of protons and neutrons
- **Proton**: positively charged particles
- **Neutron**: electrically neutral particles
-  The protons and neutrons in the nucleus account for almost all the mass of an atom.
- **Electron**: has a mass much smaller than that of a proton or neutron and a negative electric charge
- The number of protons in the nucleus determines the identity of the atom
- **Atomic Number**: refers to the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom
- The periodic table also has elements arranged so that those with similar chemical properties fall in the same column (group)
- We know that the chemical properties of elements are the consequence of the distribution of electrons in the atoms of these elements. When chemical properties repeat themselves, this signals a repeat in electronic arrangement. As we will see, the electrons farthest from the nucleus are the main determinant of chemical properties.
- The electrons in the innermost level are the most strongly attracted by the positively charged protons in the nucleus. The greater the distance between an electron and the nucleus, the weaker the attraction between them. We say that the more distant electron is in a higher energy level, which means that the electron itself possesses more potential energy.
- **Outer (Valence) Electrons**: found in the highest energy level and help to account for many of the observed trends in chemical properties
- Observe that the group designation (1A, 2A, etc.) corresponds to the number of outer electrons for the A group elements, one of the most useful organizing features of the periodic table.
- In the families (another name for groups) of elements marked “A,” the number that heads the column indicates the number of outer electrons in each atom
- Alkali metals (Group 1A)—highly reactive metals with one outer electron
- Alkaline earth metals (Group 2A)—reactive metals with two outer electrons
- Halogens (Group 7A)—reactive nonmetals with 7 outer electrons
- Noble gases (Group 8A)—unreactive nonmetals with 8 outer electrons
- **Isotopes**: two or more forms of the same element (same number of protons) whose atoms differ in number of neutrons, and hence in mass
- **Mass Number**: the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom
## **Molecules & Models**
- **Covalent Bond**: refers to two electrons that are shared. Covalent implies "shared strength"
- **Lewis Structure**: a representation of an atom or molecule that shows its outer electrons
- **Single Covalent Bond**: when two electrons (one pair) are shared between two atoms
- **Structural Formula**: representation of how the atoms in a molecule are connected.
- **Octet Rule**: The fact that electrons in many molecules are arranged so that every atom (except hydrogen) shares in eight electrons
- **Double Bond**: a covalent bond consisting of two pairs of shared electrons
- **Triple Bond**: a covalent linkage made up of three pairs of shared electrons

Whether two atoms can form a covalent bond depends upon their electronegativity i.e. the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself. If two atoms differ considerably in their electronegativity - as sodium and chloride do - then one of the atoms will lose its electron to the other atom. This results in a positively charged ion (cation) and negatively charged ion (anion). The bond between these two ions is called an **ionic bond**.
## **Waves of Light**
- **Wavelength**: the distance between sucessive peaks
  - Suggests that light behaves something like a wave in a body of water
- **Frequency**: the number of waves passing a fixed point in 1 second
  - frequency (*v*) = speed of light (c) / wavelength ($\lambda$)
- **Electromagnetic Spectrum**: a continuum of waves that ranges from short, high-energy X-rays to long, low-energy radio waves
- **Radiant Energy**: the entire collection of different wavelengths, each with its own energy

53% of the total energy emitted by the Sun is radiated to Earth as infrared radiation. This is the major source of heat for the planet. Approximately 39% of the energy comes to us as visible light and only about 8% as ultraviolet. (The areas under the curve give an indication of these percentages.) But in spite of its small percentage, the Sun's UV radiation can be the most damaging to living things.

- **Infrared (IR)**: longest of the visible spectrum, heat ray absorptions cause molecules to bend and stretch
- **Microwaves**: cause molecules to rotate
- 
## **Radiation and Matter**
- **Photons**: "particles of light"
  - Albert Einstein (1879–1955), in the work that won him the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics, suggested that radiation itself should be viewed as constituted of individual bundles of energy
- Energy (E) = hc/($\lambda$)
  - E: energy of a single photon
  - h: Planck's constant
  - c: speed of light
    - h & c are constants
  - *This equation shows that energy, E, is inversely proprtional to the wavelength, v*. As the wavelength of radiation gets shorter, its energy increases.

The Sun bombards Earth with countless photons—indivisible packages of energy. The atmosphere, the planet's surface, and Earth's living things all absorb these photons.

Photons associated with different wavelengths are absorbed, and the energy is used to “excite” electrons in biological molecules. Some electrons jump to higher energy levels, triggering a series of complex chemical reactions that ultimately lead to sight

- **Photosynthesis**: the process through which green plants (including algae) and some bacteria capture the energy of sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. 

As the wavelength of light decreases, the energy carried by each photon increases. Photons in the UV region of the spectrum are sufficiently energetic to displace electrons from neutral molecules, converting them into positively charged species

Even shorter UV wavelength photons break bonds, causing molecules to come apart. In living things, such changes disrupt cells and create the potential for genetic defects and cancer

Ultraviolet radiation is able to break some, but not all, chemical bonds

Bonds are represented as springs that hold the atoms together but allow the atoms to move relative to each other.

### **Types of UV Radiation**
- **UV-A**: least damaging and reaches the Earth's surface in greatest amount
- **UV-B**: more damaging than UV-A but less damaging than UV-C.
  - Most of UV-B is absorbed by $O_3$ in the stratosphere
- **UV-C**: Most damaging but not a problem because it is completely absorbed by $O_2$ and $O_3$ in the stratosphere
## **Ch. 3: The Chemistry of Global Climate Change**
### **In the Greenhouse: Earth's Enerygy Balance**
- The Earth receives nearly all of its energy from the Sun primarily in the form of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation.
- **Greenhouse Effect**: the natural process by which atmospheric gases trap a major portion(about 80%) of the infared radiation by the Earth
- **Greenhouse Gases**: gases capable of absorbing and emitting infared radiation, thereby warming the atmosphere.
  - Carbon dioxide
  - Water vapor
  - Methane
  - Nitrous oxide
  - Ozone
  - Chlorofluorocarbons
- The presence of those gases is essential in keeping our planet at habitable temperatures
- The exchange of energy between the Earth, atmosphere, and space results in a steady state and a continuous average temperature of the Earth. 
- The increase in concentration of greenhouse gases that is taking place today is changing the energy balance and causing increased warming of the planet
- **Enhanced Greenhouse Effect**: the process in which atmospheric gases trap and return more than 80% of the heat energy radiated by the Earth
- **Global Warming**: describes the increase in average global temperature that results from an enhanced greenhouse effect
- **Anthropogenic**: influences on the environment which stem from human activities such as industry, transportation, mining, and agriculture
  - These activities require carbon-based fuels, which produce carbon dioxide when burned
### **Gathering Evidence: The Testimony of Time**
- **Fossil Fuels**: combustible substances, of which coal, petroleum and natural gas are the most common
- Beginning about 1750, carbon dioxide began accumulating in the atmosphere at an ever-increasing rate, corresponding to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying combustion of fossil fuels that powered that transformation
- **Electromagnetic (EM) Radiation**: is a form of energy that is all around us and takes many forms, such as radio waves, microwaves, X-rays and gamma rays. Sunlight is also a form of EM energy, but visible light is only a small portion of the EM spectrum, which contains a broad range of electromagnetic wavelengths.
### **Molecules: How They Shape Up**
- Opposite charges attract and like charge repel. Negatively charged electrons are attracted to positively charged nucleus. 
- However the electrons all have the same charge and therefore are found as far from eachother in space as possible while stil maintaining their attraction to the positively charged nucleus.
- **Procedure for Predicting the Shape of a Molecule**
  - Determine the number of outer electrons associated with each atom in the molecule
  - Arrange the outer electrons in pairs to satisfy the octet rule
  - Assume that the most stable molecular shape has the bonding electron pairs as far apart as possible
- Molecules are represented in different ways
  - Chemical formula, the simplest way
  - Lewis structure
- In some molecules, the central atom has nonbonding electron pairs, also called **lone pairs**
  - A nonbonding electron pair effectively occupies greater space than a bonding pair of electrons. 
  - Consequently, the nonbonding pair repels the bonding pairs somewhat more strongly than the bonding pairs repel one another.
  - This stronger repulsion forces the bonding pairs closer to one another
- The shape of a molecule is described in terms of its arrangement of atoms, not electrons
### **Vibrating Molecules and the Greenhouse Effect**
- How do greenhouse gases trap heat?
  - how molecules respond to photons of energy
    - UV-C (high-energy photons) break the covalent bonds in Ozone
    - UV-B (low-energy photons) break the bonds of oxygen
- Water is by far the most important gas in maintaining the Earth's temperature, followed by carbon dioxide
- Methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons (such as $CCl_3F$) are among the other substances that help retain planetary heat.
- Highly energetic photons with high frequencies and short wavelengths (such as UV radiation) can break bonds within molecules. The less energetic photons (such as IR radiation) cause an increase in molecular vibration
- Another response of molecules to radiant energy is that longer wavelengths than those in the IR range have only enough energy to cause molecules to rotate faster.
  - For example, microwave ovens generate electromagnetic radiation that causes water molecules to spin faster
### **The Carbon Cycle**
1. Carbon is found in many places called resevoirs ex. atmosphere, rocks, plants & animals
2. Carbon moves from one resevoir to another ex. photosynthesis, combustion, sedimentation
3. Where carbon ends up ex. important for the benefit of humans today and in the future
- Respiration adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and photosynthesis removes it. Similarly, the oceans both absorb and emit carbon dioxide
-  Widespread burning of coal for electricity production, of petroleum products for transportation, and of natural gas for home heating all transfer carbon from the largest underground carbon reservoir into the atmosphere.
### **Quantitative Concepts: Mass**
- **Atmoic Mass**: the mass (in grams) of the same number of atoms that are found in exactly 12 g of carbon-12
- **Avogadro's Number**: the number of atoms in exactly 12 g of C-12. Avogadro's number, if written out, is 602,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. It is more compactly written in scientific notation as 6.02 × $10^23$
- **To Find Average Mass**
  - Mass of Atom/Avogadro's Number (6.02 x $10^23$)
  - Ex. Oxygen 16.00 grams
    16.00 g/6.02 x $10^23$ oxygen atoms = 2.66 x $10^-23$ g oxygen/oxygen atom
### **Quantitative Concepts: Molecules and Moles**
- **Mole (mol)**: defined as containing an Avogadro's number of objects
  - Ex. 1 mol of carbon aroms consists of 6 x $10^23$ C atoms
- **Molar Mass**: the mass of Avogadro's number, or one mole, of whatever particles specified
  - Ex. a mole of Oxygen atoms has 16.0 g
- **Calculating Moles & Molar Mass**
  - Mole-to-Mass
    - Mass = # of Moles * Molar Mass
    - Ex. 1 mole of CO^2
      - C - 12.0 g
      - O - 16.0 g
      - Molar Mass = (1 * 12.0)+(2 * 16.0)
        - = 44.0 g
    - Ex. 3 moles of CO^2
      - = 44.0 * 3
      - = 132.0 g
  - Mass-to-Moles
    - # of Moles = Mass/Molar Mass
    - Ex. # of moles of Al present in 108 g of the element
      - Al - 27 g
      - # of Moles = 108/27
        - = 4 moles
## **Ch. 4: Energy, Chemistry, & Society**
- **Combustion**: the chemical process of burning, that is the reaction of fuel w/ oxygen to release energy in the form of heat and light
- **Potential Energy**: is stored energy or the energy of position
  - Molecules that have high potential energy make good fuels. The process of combustion converts some of the potential energy of the fuel molecules into heat
- **Photosynthesis**: the energy from sunlight is converted into the potential energy of glucose and oxygen.
  - When living organisms die and decay, they release energy and reverse this process, producing CO2 and H2O
- **First Law of Thermodynamics**: also called the law of conservation of energy, states that energy is neither created nor destroyed.
- **Entropy**: a measure of how much energy gets dispersed in a given process
- **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: the entropy of the universe is constantly increasing
- **Hydrocarbons**: compounds made up of only hydrogen and carbon
- **Rules for Bonding**:
  - Octet Rule
  - Carbon Forms 4 Bonds
- **Alkanes**: hydrocarbons w/ only single bonds betwees carbon atoms
- **Distillation**: process where a solution is heated to boiling point and vapors are condensed and collected
- To distill crude oil, first it must be pumped into a large vessel (the boiler in Figure 4.11) and heated.
  - As the temperature in the boiler increases, compounds with lower boiling points (lower molar masses) begin to vaporize.
  - As the temperature further increases, compounds with higher boiling points (higher molar masses) vaporize.
  - Once vaporized, all compounds travel up the distillation tower.
  - Compounds are condensed to liquids at different heights in the tower due to a decrease in temperature with height.
- **Temperature**: a measure of the average kinetic energy of the atoms and/or molecules present in a substance
- **Heat**: the kinetic energy that flows from a hotter object to a colder one
- **Exothermic**: a term applied to any chemical or physical change accompanied by the release of heat. In this reaction, the energy difference is −802.3 kJ. The negative sign attached to the energy change for all exothermic reactions signifies the decrease in potential energy going from reactants to products. Not surprisingly, the amount of energy released depends on the amount of fuel burned.
- **Endothermic**: the term applied to any chemical or physical change that absorbs energy. A chemical reaction is endothermic when the potential energy of the products is higher than that of the reactants. The energy change for an endothermic reaction is always positive
- **Catalytic Cracking**: a process in which catalysts are used to crack larger hydrocarbon molecules into smaller ones at relatively low temperatures, thus reducing energy use
- **Catalytic Reforming**: the atoms within a molecule are rearranged, usually starting with linear molecules and producing ones with more branches
- **Oxygenated Gasolines**: blends of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons with added oxygen-containing compounds such as MTBE, ethanol, or methanol (CH3OH). Because they contain oxygen, these gasoline blends burn more cleanly and produce less carbon monoxide than their nonoxygenated counterparts.
- **Reformulated Gasolines**: oxygenated gasolines that also contain a lower percentage of certain more volatile hydrocarbons found in nonoxygenated conventional gasoline
- **Driving Forces of Reactions**
  - towards lower energy    ->    exothermic reactions
  - toward increasing entropy (disorder)    ->   solids to gases ex. dynamite
- **The Reaction Process**:
  - **Collision Theory**:
  - **Activation Energy**:
  - **Catalyst**:
- **Reaction Rates are Influenced by**:
  - Nature of bonds in molecules
  - Surface area
  - Temperature
  - Concentration
  - Catalyst

Ch. 3
**Ionic Bond**
**Covalent Bond**: consist of pairs of electrons shared by two atoms and bind the atoms in a fixed orientation
**Electromagnetic (EM) Radiation**: is a form of energy that is all around us and takes many forms, such as radio waves, microwaves, X-rays and gamma rays. Sunlight is also a form of EM energy, but visible light is only a small portion of the EM spectrum, which contains a broad range of electromagnetic wavelengths.

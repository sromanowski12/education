Ch. 1: **The Air We Breathe**

1.1: 
- **Air**:
  - Nitrogen: 78%
  - Oxygen: 21%
  - Other Substances: 1%
- **Percentage**: *means* "parts per hundred"
  - based on volume, the amout of space each gas occupies
- **Respiration**: process where foods we eat are metabolized to produce carbon dioxide and water

1.2: **What Else Is in a Breath?**
- **Parts Per Million (PPM)**: used for low concentrations
- Carbon Monoxide
- Ozone
- Sulfur Dioxide
- Nitrogen Dioxide
- Particulate Matter

1.3: **Air Pollutants & Risk Assessment**
- **Risk Assessment**: the process of evaluating scientific data and making predications in an organized manner about the probabilities of an outcome
- **Toxicity**: the intrinsic health hazard of a substance
- **Exposure**: the amount of the substance encountered
  - Depends on factors such as:
    - **Concentration in the air**
      - Expressed as parts per million or as micrograms per cubic meter
      - **Microgram**: a millionth of a gram
    - **Length of time**
    - **Rate of breathing**
- **Ambient Air**: the air surrounding us
- **Scientific Notation**: a system for writing numbers as the product of a number and 10 raised to the appropriate power
- **Parts Per Billion (PPB)**: one part out of one billion
  - 1000 times less concentrated htan one part per million

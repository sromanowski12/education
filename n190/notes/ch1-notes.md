Ch. 1: **The Air We Breathe**

1.1: **What's in a Breath?**

- **Mixture**: a physical combination of two or more pure substances present in variable amounts
- **Air**:
  - Nitrogen: 78%
  - Oxygen: 21%
  - Other Substances: 1%
- **Percentage**: _means_ "parts per hundred"
  - based on volume, the amout of space each gas occupies
- **Respiration**: process where foods we eat are metabolized to produce carbon dioxide and water

  1.2: **What Else Is in a Breath?**

- **Parts Per Million (ppm)**: used for low concentrations
- Carbon Monoxide (CO): "silent killer" - has no color, taste, or smell
  - Sources: automobiles, charcoal grills, and propane stoves
- Ozone ($O_3$): sharp odor, low concentrations can reduce lung function
  - Sources: electric motors, welding equipment
- Sulfur Dioxide ($SO_2$): sharp, unpleasent odor
  - Sources: burning of coal
- Nitrogen Dioxide ($NO_2$)
- Particulate Matter (PM)

  1.3: **Air Pollutants & Risk Assessment**

- **Risk Assessment**: the process of evaluating scientific data and making predications in an organized manner about the probabilities of an outcome
  - existing air quality standards can offer you guidance. We say guidance, because standards are set through a complex interaction of scientists, medical experts, governmental agencies, and politicians
- **Toxicity**: the intrinsic health hazard of a substance
- **Exposure**: the amount of the substance encountered
  - Depends on factors such as:
    - **Concentration in the air**: the more toxic the pollutant, the lower its concentration must be set
      - Concentrations are expressed as parts per million or as micrograms per cubic meter
      - **Microgram**: a millionth of a gram
    - **Length of time**: Higher concentrations of a pollutant can be tolerated only briefly
    - **Rate of breathing**: Physically active people, such as athletes or laborers, breathe at a higher rate. If the air quality is poor, reducing activity is one way to reduce exposure
- **Ambient Air**: the air surrounding us, usually outside air
- **Scientific Notation**: a system for writing numbers as the product of a number and 10 raised to the appropriate power
- **Parts Per Billion (ppb)**: one part out of one billion

  - 1000 times less concentrated htan one part per million

  1.4: **Air Quality & You**

  - U.S. Clean Air Act (1970) that led to the establishment of air quality standards. Like many environmental laws, this one focused on limiting our exposure to hazardous substances. It has been named as a “command and control law” or an “end of the pipe solution” because it tries to limit the spread of hazardous substances or clean them up after the fact.
  - The Pollution Prevention Act (1990) was a significant piece of legislation that followed the Clean Air Act. It focused on preventing the formation of hazardous substances, stating that “pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible.”

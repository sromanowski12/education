### **Ch. 6: Neutralizing Acid Rain**
- Chemical Properties of Acid ...
- **Acid**: a compound that releases hydrogen ions in aqueous solution
- **Strong Acid**: an acid that dissociates completley in aqueous solution
- **Weak Acid**: an acid that dissociates only to a small extent in aqueous solution
- **Base**: a compound that release hydroxide ions in aqueous solution
  - bases generally taste bitter and do not lend an appealing flavor to foods
  - Aqueous solutions of bases have a slippery, soapy feel
  - Common examples of bases include household ammonia (an aqueous solution) and lye
- **Strong Base**: bases that dissociate completely in water
  - Ex. NaOH - Lye
- **Weak Base**: a base that dissociates only to a small extent in aqueous solution

    FROM cape_codd.retail_order
    JOIN cape_codd.order_item ON cape_codd.order_item.OrderNumber = cape_codd.retail_order.OrderNumber
    JOIN cape_codd.sku_data ON cape_codd.sku_data.SKU = cape_codd.order_item.SKU
    GROUP BY StoreNumber, StoreZip;
    ```
- **Question 2:**
Generate the following report of warehouses and their inventory data; excluding the warehouses with no inventory.

    SELECT cape_codd.warehouse.WarehouseID, CONCAT(cape_codd.warehouse.WarehouseCity, " ", cape_codd.warehouse.WarehouseState) AS city_state,
    COUNT(DISTINCT inventory.SKU) AS distinct_sku_count,
    SUM(inventory.QuantityOnHand) AS current_inventory,
    SUM(inventory.QuantityOnOrder) AS quantity_ordered
    FROM cape_codd.warehouse
    JOIN cape_codd.inventory ON cape_codd.inventory.WarehouseID = cape_codd.warehouse.WarehouseID
    GROUP BY warehouse.WarehouseID, city_state;    
    ```

### 4.3.5
    
- **Question 1**
    Report the quantity of sale items for each department; regardless of whether the department has any sale item or not. Sort the departments in descending order of sale item count.

    GROUP BY sku_data.Department
    ORDER BY saleitem_quantity DESC;
    ```

- **Question 2**
  Generate the following report of warehouses and their inventory data; regardless of whether the warehouse has inventory or not.

    ```sql
    SELECT warehouse.WarehouseID, CONCAT(warehouse.WarehouseCity, " ", warehouse.WarehouseState) AS city_state, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT inventory.SKU) AS distinct_sku_count,
    SUM(inventory.QuantityOnHand) AS current_inventory,
    SUM(inventory.QuantityOnOrder) AS quantity_ordered
    FROM cape_codd.warehouse
    LEFT JOIN inventory ON inventory.WarehouseID = warehouse.WarehouseID
    GROUP BY warehouse.WarehouseID;  
    ```
### 4.4.5

- Question 1
Write an SQL statement to join Warehouse and Inventory tables and include all rows of Warehouse in your answer; regardless of whether they have any inventory. For each warehouse, add two new columns for its SKU count and total QuanitityOnHand, respectively. Sort the results in descending order of total QuantityOnHand. Replace any NULL total or count with an zero

    ```sql
    SELECT warehouse.WarehouseID, CONCAT(warehouse.WarehouseCity, " ", warehouse.WarehouseState) AS city_state,
    warehouse.WarehouseState,
    warehouse.Manager,
    warehouse.SquareFeet,
    COUNT(inventory.SKU) AS sku_count,
    (CASE 
        WHEN SUM(inventory.QuantityOnHand) IS NULL THEN 0
        ELSE SUM(inventory.QuantityOnHand)
    END) AS total_quantityonhand
    FROM cape_codd.warehouse
    LEFT JOIN inventory ON inventory.WarehouseID = warehouse.WarehouseID
    GROUP BY warehouse.WarehouseID;
    ```
### 4.5.4
- **Question 1**
(Intersect keyword) What products were available for sale (by either catalog or web site) in both 2014 and 1015?

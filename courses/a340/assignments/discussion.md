Three Questions:  (in the context of this week's lecture: CSS)

1) What is one topic in this week's lecture material that is still confusing to you?

This week's lecture material wasn't difficult to understand. I feel that after reading the material and doing the labs that I understanding CSS much better now.

2) What is one topic that was initially confusing to you this week, but through additional reading (textbook, online resources, etc.) labs, experimentation, etc you were able to understand it?

I was initially confused about the different ways CSS was defined. I wasn't sure about how the CSS definition impacted it's usage throughout the HTML file. After completing the labs and reviewing the powerpoint I was comfortable with using each method for defining CSS.

3) What is one topic that you would like to know/learn more about?

I think pseudo-class selectors is an interesting concept and would like to learn more about it.

### **[Discussion 4](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1815301/discussion_topics/8572867)**
Two Questions:

- What is one specific thing about this course or my work as an instructor that I should keep doing because it has helped your learning in this course?
- What is one specific thing that you as a student should keep doing because it has helped your learning in this course?
---
As an instructor I feel that you do an excellent job of providing essential and resourceful material. The videos and PowerPoint slides are detailed and extremely helpful.

As a student I try to take a lot of notes. I feel that it is helpful not only for the benefit of being able to study from them but also because taking them allows the information to flow throughout my mind and body which helps me remember things. I usually take notes by writing it down (index cards or paper), and/or by typing them.

Some resources & tools I use for taking notes include Anki, Evernote + Evertool, GitHub, Markdown, & VS Code.

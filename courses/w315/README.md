**COURSE DESCRIPTION**: 

Writing for the Web introduces students to some new types of technology, but the focus of the course is on the rhetorical strategies used to write professional, engaging material for different mediums housed on the Internet (concentrating on e-news and websites). With the rise in remote work in the 21st century, especially during the current pandemic, knowing how to write effectively in a web medium has become an increasingly important skill and can set you apart in the job market.

You will produce web writing for professional purposes and formally analyze effective and ineffective web design and content, leading to the creation of your original, insightful website with substantial content. The course will involve research, planning, drafting and revising a variety of writings with consideration for the context, design, and audience in each case. Over the course of the semester, you will learn skills to help adapt your writing to a web versus a print medium.

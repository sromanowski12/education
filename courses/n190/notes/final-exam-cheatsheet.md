- **Mole (mol)**: defined as containing an Avogadro's number of objects
  - Ex. 1 mol of carbon aroms consists of 6 x $10^23$ C atoms
- **Molar Mass**: the mass of Avogadro's number, or one mole, of whatever particles specified
  - Ex. a mole of Oxygen atoms has 16.0 g
- **Calculating Moles & Molar Mass**
  - _Mole-to-Mass_
    - Mass = # of Moles * Molar Mass
    - Ex. 1 mole of CO^2
      - C - 12.0 g
      - O - 16.0 g
      - Molar Mass = (1 * 12.0)+(2 * 16.0)
        - = 44.0 g
    - Ex. 3 moles of CO^2
      - = 44.0 * 3
      - = 132.0 g
  - _Mass-to-Moles_
    - # of Moles = Mass/Molar Mass
    - Ex. # of moles of Al present in 108 g of the element
      - Al - 27 g
      - # of Moles = 108/27
        - = 4 moles
### **Ch. 5**
- **Properties of Water**
  - High Boiling Point, 100 C (212 F)
  - Expands When Freezing (*typically liquids contract when freezing*)
  - **Unusual Properties Derive from the Molecular Structure**
    -  Many of the unique properties of water are a consequence of its polarity. 
- High Electronegativity = More Attraction to Electrons in Chemical Bond
- Polarity of Bond = Difference in Electronegativity of Two Bonded Atoms
  - *Used to Estimate Bond Polarity*
  - **Polar Covalent Bond**
  - **Nonpolar Covalent Bond**
- To Predict if Molecule is Polar - Two Generalizations
1. A molecule that contains only nonpolar bonds must be nonpolar
2. A molecule that contains polar covalent bonds may or may nore be polar

- **Solvent**: Ex. water - a substance, often a liquid, that is capable of dissolving one or more pure substances
- **Solute**: solid, liquid, or gas that dissolves in a solvent
- **Aqueous Solution**: solutions in which water is the solvent

- **Concentration**
- **Molarity (M)**

- **Nonelectrolyte**: a solute that is nonconducting in an aqueous solution
- **Electrolyte**: a solute that conducts electricity in an aqueous solution
  - Ex. Sodium Chloride, NaCl
- **Ion**: an atom or group of atoms that has acquired a net electric charge as a result of gaining or losing one or more electrons
- **Cation**: a positively charged ion
- **Anion**: a negatively charged ion
- **Ionic Bond**: the chemical bondformed when oppositely charged ions attract
  - ionic bonding holds together a large assembly of ions
- **Ionic Compound**: composed of ions that are present in fixed proportions and arranged in a regular, geometric structure

- Electron transfer to form cations and anions occurs between metallic elements and nonmetallic elements
  - Metals - strong tendency to give up electrons and form positive ions
    - Low electronegativity
  - Nonmetals - strong attraction for electrons and readily gain them to form negative ions
    - High electronegativity

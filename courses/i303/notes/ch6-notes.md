# **Ch. 6 - Data: Business Intelligence**
- Information Granularity: the extent of detail within the information (fine & detailed or coarse & abstract)
- **Four Primary Traits of the Value of Information**
  - Information Type
  - Information Timeliness
  - Information Quality
  - Information Governance
## **Information Type**
- **Two Primary Types of Information**:
  - Transactional Information: all of the information contained within a single business process or unit of work
    - Primary purpose is to support daily operational tasks
  - Analytical Information: all organizational information
    - Primary purpose is to support the performance of managerial analysis tasks
## **Information Timeliness**
- Real-Time Information: immmediate, up-to-date information
- Real-Time Systems: provides real-time information in response to requests
## **Information Quality**
- Information Inconsistency: when the same data element has different values
- Information Integrity Issues: when a system produces incorrect, inconsistent, or duplicate data
- **Five Common Characteristics of High-Quality Information**:
  - Accurate
  - Complete
  - Consistent
  - Timely
  - Unique
- **Costs of Using Low-Quality Information**:
  - Inability to track customers accurately.
  - Difficulty identifying the organization's most valuable customers.
  - Inability to identify selling opportunities.
  - Lost revenue opportunities from marketing to nonexistent customers.
  - The cost of sending undeliverable mail.
  - Difficulty tracking revenue because of inaccurate invoices.
  - Inability to build strong relationships with customers.
## **Information Governance**
- Data Governance: the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of company data
- Master Data Management (MDM): the practice of gathering data and ensuring that it is uniform, accurate, consistent, and complete
## **Storing Information Using a Relational Database Management System**
- Database: maintains information about various types of objects (inventory), events (transactions), people (employees), and places (warehouses)
- Database Management System (DBMS): creates, reads, updates, and deletes data in a database while controlling access and security. Managers send requests to the DBMS, and the DBMS performs the actual manipulation of the data in the database
- Query-by-Example: tool that helps uses graphically design the answer to a question against a database
- Structured Query Language (SQL): asks users to write lines of code to answer questions against a database
- Data Element (Data Field): the smallest or basic unit of information
- Data Models: logical data structures that detail the relationships among data elements by using graphics or pictures
- Metadata: provides detail about data
  - Ex. image - size, resolution, and date created; text document: document length, date created, author's name, and summary
- Data Dictionary: compiles all of the metadata about the data elements in the data model
- Relational Database Model: stores information in the form of logically related two-dimensional tables
- Relational Database Management System: allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in a relational database. Although the hierarchical and network models are important, this text focuses only on the relational database mode
- Entity (Table): stores information about a person, place, thing, transaction, or event. They are entities, or tables, of interest
- Attributes (Columns or Fields): the data elements associated with an entity
- Record: a collection of related data elements
- Primary Key: a field (or group of fields) that uniquely identifies a given record in a table
- Foreign Key: a primary key of one table that appears as an attribute in another table and acts to provide a logical relationship between two tables
- Physical View of Information: dealds with the physical storage of information on a storage device
- Logical View of Information: focuses on how individual users logically access information to meet their ow particular business needs
- Information Redundancy: the duplication of data, or the storage of the same data in multiple places
- Information Integrity: a measure  of the quality of information
- Integrity Constraints: rules that help ensure the quality of information
- Relational Integrity Constraints: rules that enforce basic and fundamental information-based constraints
- Business Rule: defines how a company performs certain aspects of its business and typically results in either a yes/no or true/false answer
- Business-Crtical Integrity Constraints: enforce business rules vital to an organization's success and often require more insight and knowledge than relational integrity constraints. 
  - Business-critical integrity constraints tend to mirror the very rules by which an organization achieves success.
## **Driving Websites with Data**
- Content Creator: the person responsible for creating the original website content
- Content Editor: the person responsible for updating and maintaining website content
- Static Informaiton: fixed data incapable of change in the event of a user action
- Dynamic Information: data that changes based on user actions
- Dynamic Catalog: an area of a website that stores information about products in a database
- Data-Driven Website: an interactive website kept constantly updated and relevant to the needs of its customers using a database
- **Data-Driven Website Advantages**:
  - Easy to manage content
  - Easy to store large amounts of data
  - Easy to eliminate human errors
- Data Warehouse: a logical collection of information, gathered from many operational databases that support business analysis activites and decision-making tasks
- **Three Core Concepts of Data Warehousing**:
  - Data Mart
  - Information Cleasing or Scrubbing
  - Data Mining
- Extraction, Transformation, & Loading (ETL): a process that extracts information from internal and external databases, transforms it using a common set of enterprise definitions, and loads it into a data warehouse. The data warehouse then sends portions (or subsets) of the information to data marts
- Data Mart: contains a subset of data warehouse information
- Information Cube: the common term for the representation of multidimensional information
- Dirty Data: erroneous or flawed data
- Information Cleansing or Scrubbing: a process that weeds out and fixes or discards inconsistent, incorrect, or incomplete information
- Data Quality Audits: determine the accuracy and completeness ofits data. Most organizations determine a percentage of accuracy and completeness high enough to make good decisions at a reasonable cost, such as 85 percent accurate and 65 percent complete.
- Data Mining: the proces of analyzing data to extract information not offered by the raw data alone
- Data-Mining Tools: use a variety of techniques to find patterns and relationships in large volumes of information that predict future behavior and guide decision making
- Structured Data: has a defined length, type, and format and includes numbers, dates, or strings such as Customer Address. Structured data is typically stored in a traditional system such as a relational database or spreadsheet and accounts for about 20 percent of the data that surrounds us.
  - Machine-Generated Data: created by a machine without human intervention. Machine-generated structured data includes sensor data, point-of-sale data, and web log (blog) data.
  - Human-Generated Data: data that humans, in interaction with computers, generate. Human-generated structured data includes input data, click-stream data, or gaming data.
- Unstructured Data:
- Big Data: a collection of large, complex data sets, including structured and unstructured data, which cannot be analyzed using traditional database methods and tools
- **Four Common Characteristics of Big Data**
  - Variety
  - Veracity
  - Volume
  - Velocity
- Distributed Computing: processes and manages algorithms across many machines in a computing environment
- Advanced Anlysis: focuses on forecasting future trends and producing insights using sophisticated quantitative methods, including statistics, descriptive and predictive data mining, simulation, and optimization.
- Data Scientist: extracts knowledge from data by performing statistical analysis, data mining, and advanced analytics on big data to identify trends, market changes, and other relevant information.
- Infographics: present the results of data analysis, displaying the patterns, relationships, and trends in a graphical format
- Advanced Paralysis: occurs when the user goes into an emotional state of over-analysis (or over-thinking) a situation so that a decision or action is never taken, in effect paralyzing the outcome.
- Data Visualization: describes technologies that allow users to see or visualize data to transform information into a business perspective.
- Data Visualization Tools:
- Business Intelligence Dashboards: track corporate metrics such as critical success factors and key performance indicators and include advanced capabilities such as interactive controls, allowing users to manipulate data for analysis
- Data Artist

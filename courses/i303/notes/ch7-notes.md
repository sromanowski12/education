- **Attenuation**: represents the loss of a network signal strength measured in decibels (dB) and occurs because the transmissions gradually dissipate in strength over longer distances or because of radio interference or physical obstructions such as walls
- **Repeater**: receives and repeats a signal to redue it attenuation and extend its range

The Internet is a hierarchical structure linking different levels of service providers, whose millions of devices, LANs, WANs, and MANs supply all the interconnections
- **National Service Providers (NSPs)**: private companies that own and maintain the worldwide backbone that supports the Internet.
  - These include Sprint, Verizon, MCI (previously UUNet/WorldCom), AT&T, NTT, Level3, Century Link, and Cable & Wireless Worldwide.
- **Regional Service Providers (RSPs)**: offer Internet service by connecting to NSPs and each other 
- **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**: specializes in providing management, support, and maintenance to a network
  -  Individuals and companies use local ISPs to connect to the Internet, and large companies tend to connect directly using an RSP. Major ISPs in the United States include AOL, AT&T, Comcast, Earthlink, and NetZero.
-  **Bandwidth**: measures network performance and is the maximum amount of data that can pass from one point to another ina unit of time
-  **Bit**: (short for binary digit) the smallest element of data and has a value of either 0 or 1
-  **Bit Rate (Data Rate)**: how bandwidth is measured and is the number of bits transferred or received per unit of time
-  **Modem**: a device that enables a computer to transmit and receive data
-  **Broadband**: a high-speed Internet connection that is always connected
-  **Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)**: provides high-speed digital data transmission over standard telephone lines using broadband modem technology, allowing both Internet and telephone services to work over the same phone lines
-  **High-Speed Internet Cable Connections**: provide Internet access using a cable television company's infrastructure and a special cable modem
-  **Cable Modem (Broadband Modem)**: a type of digital modem used with high-speed cable Internet service

Cable modems connect a home computer (or network of home computers) to residential cable TV service; DSL modems connect to residential public telephone service. The ISP typically supplies the cable and DSL modems
-  **Telecommuting (Virtual Workforce)**: allows users to work from remote locations, such as home or a hotel, using high-speed Internet to access business applications and data

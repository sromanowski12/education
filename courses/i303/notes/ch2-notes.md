### **Decision-Making Process**

- **Analytics**: the science of fact-based decision making.
- **The Six-Step Decision-Making Process**

1. Problem Identification: define the problem as clearly and precisely as possible
2. Data Collection: gather problem-related data, including who, what, where, when, why, and how. Be sure to gather facts, not rumors or opinions about the problem.
3. Solution Generation: detail every solution possible, including ideas that seem farfetched.
4. Solution Test: evaluate solutions in terms of feasibility, suitability, and acceptability.
5. Solution Selection: select the solution that best solves the problem and meets the needs of the business.
6. Solution Implementation: if the solution solves the problem, then decisions made were correct. If not, then the decisions were incorrect and the process begins again.

- **Operational Level**: employees develop, control, and maintain core business activites required to run the day-to-day operations.
  - Operational decisions are considered **structured decisions** which arise when established processes offer potential solutions.
- **Managerial Level**: employees are continuously evaluating company operations to hone the firm's abilities to identify, adapt to, and leverage change.
  - These types of decisions are considered **semistructured decisions**; they occur in situations in which a few established processes help to evaluate potential solutions, but not enough to lead to a definite recommended decision.
- **Strategic Level**: managers develop overall business strategies, goals, and objectives as part of the company's strategic plan. They also monitor strategic performance of the organization and its overall direction in the political, economic, and competitive business environment.
  - Strategic decisiosn are highly **unstructured decisions**, occuring in situations in which no procedures or rules exist to guide decision makers towards the correct choice.

### **Measuring Organizational Business Decisions**

- **Project**: a temporary activity a company undertakes to create a unique product, service, or result.
- **Metrics**: measurements that evaluate results to determine whether a project is meeting its goals.
  - Two core metrics:

1. **Critival Success Factors**: the crucial steps companies perform to achieve their goals and objectives and implement their strategies
2. **Key Performance Indicators**: the quantifiable metrics a company uses to evaluate progress toward critical success factors.

### **Collision Resolution**

- **Techniques**
**Collision in Hashing**
1. In this, the hash function is used to compute the index of the array.
2. The hash value is used to store the keys in the hash table, as an index.
3. The hash function can return the same hash value for two or more keys.
4. When two or more keys are given to the same hash value, it is called *collision*. To handle this collision, we use collision resolution techniques.

#### **Collision Resolution Techniques**
There are two types of collision resolution techniques.
1. Seperate chaining (open hashing)
2. Open addressing (closed hashing)

##### **Seperate Chaining**

**Time Complexity**

**Advantages**

**Disadvantages***

##### **Open Addressing**

##### **Linar Probing**

##### **Quadratic Probing**

##### **Double Hashing**

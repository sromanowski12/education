# Week 9 - Racket: Regular Expressions

## Reading:
- Scott 4e - Section 2.1.1 - Tokens & Regular Expressions
- Scott 4e - Section 2.2.1 - Generating Finite Automata
- Scott 4e - Section 2.4.1 - Finite Automata (on the companion side)

**Why Regular Expressions?**
used to implement scanning (lexical analysis)
- regular expressions are often used in applications that are reduced to the Pattern Matching problem

**What are Regular Expressions?**
- a regular expression is one of the following,
  - a character
  - an empty string, denoted by $\varepsilon$

**Meaning of Regular Expressions**
A regular expression generates a set of string (called a **regular set** or a **regular language**) based on the following rules:

| **Regular Expression** | **Strings generated** |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| $\varepsilon$ | The empty string |
| Character c | The string containing c |
| Two regular expressions concatenated | The strings generated by the two regular expressions concatenated |
| Two regular expressions seperated by | | any string generated by the first regular expression followed by any string generated by the second regular expression |
| A regular expression followed by the Kleene star * | The strings generated by the regular expression concatenated with any strings generated by the regular expression |

**Examples**

| **Regular Expression** | **Strings generated** |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| $\varepsilon$ | The empty string |
| $\oplus$  | checkmark |
| +|-|$\varepsilon$ | +, -, empty string |
| ( 0 | 1 )( + | - | $\varepsilon$ ) | 0+, 0-, 0, 1, 1+, 1- |
| ( 0 | 1 )* | Any binary string |
| ( 0 | 1 )*( + | - | $\varepsilon$ ) | Any binary string, and any binary string followed by a + or a - |


**Named Regular Expressions**
**Finite Automata**
**Finite Automata - Formal Definition**
**Deterministic Finite Automation (DFA)**
**Nondeterministic Finite Automation (NFA)**
**Computation of DFA**
**Computation of NFA**
**From a Regular Expression to NFA**
- **Concatenation**
- **Alternation**
- **Kleene Closure**

### Tasks

Write a Racket program that contains definitions from exercises below. 

### Exercise 1

Define a function named **mycar** that takes one parameter **s** and draws a "car" with size propositional to **s** as shown in sample evaluations below In particular, the car must have three components: **wheel**, **base** and **top**. 

The wheel consists of two circle whose size is **2s**. The base of the rectangle filled with blue and height **2s** and width is **8s**. The top is a red rectangle with width **6s** and height **3s**.

The function body must use a **let** form to define those three components of the car (one binding clause for each component)

### Exercise 2

Define a function named **mycar** that takes one parameter **s** and draws a "car" with size propositional to **s** as shown in sample evaluations below In particular, the car must have three components: **wheel**, **base** and **top** but the top half of the wheels are overlapped with the base.

In addition to the three binding clauses for those three components, the function body must define a binding clause for the combination of **wheels** and **base**, and this new binding clause must refer to the binding for wheels and base. Thus you will find that you cannot use the **let** form in the case, and you mus use the **let*** form instead.

Note that to combine two pictures vertically that overlap each other, you can use **vc-append** function with an additional argument that is a negative number.

Ex.
```racket
> (vc-append -10 (circle 20) (circle 20))
```

Exams
Each exam consists of 2 essay questions (10 points each) and 50 multiple choice questions at 2 points each, for a total of 120 points. You will have 75 minutes to complete them. Unlike your quizzes, you will see only one question at a time in the exam – but you can move back and forth by question number

Syllabus Quiz
This is a prerequisite assignment that ensures that you know some of the basic features of this course, including:
* How many assignments in each category you have.
* How to access Mastering.
* How to use LockDown Browser.
* Other details that you should know from the "Start Here and Syllabus Quiz"

**Learning Objectives**
1. Generalize the nature of science and scientific inquiry and identify key components.
2. Evaluate the impact of astronomy on society.
3. Describe and distinguish the various scales and organizations in the universe.
4. Summarize the positions, motions and the causes of motions of objects.
5. Demonstrate an understanding of how light is used to provide information about distant objects.
6. Compare and contrast stars by various physical parameters.
7. Describe stellar evolution for various types of stars.
8. Compare and contrast galaxies by various physical parameters.
9. Organize the structure and nature of the universe by time and by space.



**Preparing for Exams**
Study the Review Questions, and rework problems and other assignments; try additional questions to be sure you understand the concepts. Study your performance on assignments, quizzes, or exams from earlier in the term.

Work through the relevant chapter quizzes and other study resources available at the MasteringAstronomy® site.

Study your notes from lectures and discussions. Pay attention to what your instructor expects you to know for an exam.

Reread the relevant sections in the textbook, paying special-attention to notes you have made on the pages.

Study individually before joining a study group with friends. Study groups are effective only if every individual comes prepared to contribute.

Don’t stay up too late before an exam. Don’t eat a big meal within an hour of the exam (thinking is more difficult when blood is being diverted to the digestive system).

Try to relax before and during the exam. If you have studied effectively, you are capable of doing well. Staying relaxed will help you think clearly.

A Modern View of the Universe
**Learning Goals**
THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE: What is our place in the universe? How big is the universe?

THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE: How did we come to be? How do our lifetimes compare to the age of the universe?

SPACESHIP EARTH: How is Earth moving through space? How do galaxies move within the universe?

THE HUMAN ADVENTURE OF ASTRONOMY: How has the study of astronomy affected human history?

Ch. 2 - The Big Picture
You can enhance your enjoyment of astronomy by observing the sky. The more you learn about the appearance and apparent motions of the sky, the more you will appreciate what you can see in the universe.

From our vantage point on Earth, it is convenient to imagine that we are at the center of a great celestial sphere—even though we really are on a planet orbiting a star in a vast universe. We can then understand what we see in the local sky by thinking about how the celestial sphere appears from our latitude.

Most of the phenomena of the sky are relatively easy to observe and understand. The more complex phenomena—particularly eclipses and apparent retrograde motion of the planets—challenged our ancestors for thousands of years. The desire to understand these phenomena helped drive the development of science and technology.

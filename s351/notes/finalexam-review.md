**Theoretical Statistics**


**Sample**: $n$

- **Sample**: $(\bar{x})$

### **Standard Deviation**
- **Population**: $\sigma=\sqrt{(\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}/N$
- **Sample**: $s=\sqrt{(\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}/n-1$

### **Standard Variance**
- **Population**: $\sigma^2$
- **Sample**: $s^2$

### **Confidence Intervals**
$\bar{x}+-(z)(\sigma_{\bar{x}})$
$\bar{x}\plusmn(t)(s_{\bar{x}})$

**Random Sampling**

How to draw a random sample:

**Population Distribution**

**Sample Distributions**

**Sampling Distributions**

**Standard Error of the Mean**
- A measure of dispersion in the sampling distribution of the mean
  - The smaller the standard error, the less spread there is among the sample means (and the higher our confidence in estimating the population mean)
- Interpreted in the original units of X
- $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ - is also considered a measure of sampling error

- Sample
- Population


**Confidence Intervals**
- **Steps in Constructing Confidence Intervals**:
1. Calculate your statistic (i.e. $\bar{x}$) and standard error of that statistic (i.e. $s_{\bar{x}}$ or $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$)
2. Choose a level of confidence, such as 95% or 99%
3. Identify the z scores or t scores that correspond to your level of confidence
4. Construct your interval range (range of values) using one of the following formulas:

$\bar{x}\plusmn(z)(\sigma_{\bar{x}})$ or $\bar{x}\plusmn(t)(s_{\bar{x}})$

**Hypothesis**: educated guesses about characteristics of a population or about relationships within a population

**Hypothesis Testing**
- **Steps for Hypothesis Testing**

**Step 1.** Null and Alternative Hypothesis

**Step 2.** Describe the statistic from the sample ($\bar{x})

**Step 3.** Select the appropriate sampling destribution and establish a critical region (i.e. an area of rejection)

-  Identify sampling distribution
-  Determine the direction, one/two-tailed
-  Choose a level of significance
-  Identify critical value

**Step 4.** Calculate the appropriate test (observed) statistic

**Step 5.** Make a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis and draw a conclusion about this decision

**Null Hypothesis**: $H_0$ - the hypothesis you are actually testing

**Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_1$ - the hypothesis you expect to be true

**Level of Significance** - $\alpha$
- *Area of Rejection*

**Type 1 Error**


Column A | Column B | Column C
---------|----------|---------
A1 | B1 | C1
A2 | B2 | C2
A3 | B3 | C3


**Type 2 Error**

**Correlation Coefficient (r)**: (Pearson Correlation Coefficient)measures the degree to which a linear relationship exists between two variables.
- It captures both the strength and direction of a relationship
- **Properties of r**:
1. Ranges from +1 to -1
- Positive r values indicate a positive relationship
- Negative r values indicate a negative relationship

**Relationship**
**Liner Relationship**
**Positive Relationship**
**Perfect Positive Relationship**
+1
**Negative Relationship**
**Perfect Negative Relationship**
-1
**Non-Linear Relationship**

0 - means that there is no linear relationship between the variables

**Hypothesis Testing (w/ Correlation)**
Ex.
Is family income significantly correlated with the incidence of violence against wives? You obtain a random sample of n = 50 and compute r = -.51

**Line**
**Slope**
**Y-Intercept (Origin)**

**Regression**
**Slope of a Regression Line**
**Interpretation of Slope of a Regression Line**
Ex.
For each hour of video games a child plays, he/she gets into .3 fights per week

b_pop: Population parameter for slope (b)

**How to plot a regression Line**
Step 1. Compute b from raw data
Step 2. Compute a
Step 3. You need 2 points to draw a line, so you use the formula for a regression line to find these two points

**Hypothesis Testing (w/ Regression)**
Ex.
Does playing video games cause kids to be more violent? We obtain data on this issue from 25 children. We compute b = .3 and r = .61

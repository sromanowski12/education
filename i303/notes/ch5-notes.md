## **MIS Infrastructures**
- **MIS Infrastructure**: includes the plans for how a firm will build, deploy, use, and share its data, processes, and MIS assets.
  - A solid MIS infrastructure can reduce costs, improve productivity, optimize business operations, generate growth, and increase profitability
- **Hardware**: consists of the physical devices associated with a computer system
- **Software**: the set of instructions the hardware executes to carry out specific tasks
- **Network**: a communications system created by linking two or more devices and establishing a standard methodology in which they can communicate
- **Client**: a computer designated to request information from a server
- **Server**: a computer dedicated to providing information in response to requests
- Ex. when someone uses a web browser (client) to access a website (server)
- **Enterprise Architect**: a person grounded in technology, fluent in business, and able to provide the important bridge between MIS and the business
  - Employed to help manage change and dynamically update MIS infrastructure
- **MIS Infrastructures**:
  - **Information MIS Infrastructure**: identifies where and how important information, such as customer records, is maintained and secured
  - **Agile MIS Infrastructure**: includes the hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment that, when combined, provides the underlyning foundation to support the organization's goals
  - **Sustainable MIS Infrastructure**: identifies ways that a company can grow in terms of computing resources while simultaneously becoming less dependent on hardware and energy consumption
## **Supporting Operations: Information MIS Infrastructure**
- To support continuous business operations, an information infrastructure provides three primary elements:
  - Backup and recovery plan
  - Disaster recovery plan
  - Business continuity plan
### **Backup and Recovery Plan**
- **Backup**: an exact copy of a system's information
- **Recovery**: the ability to get a system up and running in the event of a system crash or failure that includes restoring the information backup
- **Fault Tolerance**: the ability fro a system to respond to unexpected failures or system crashes as the backup system immediately and automatically takes over with no loss of service
- **Failover**: a specific type of fault tolerance, occurs when a redundant storage server offers an exact replica of the real-time data, and if the primary server crashes, the users are automatically directed to the secondary server or backup server
- **Failback**: occurs when the priary machine recovers and resumes operations, taking over from the secondary server
- Deciding how often to back up information and what media to use is a critical decision. Companies should choose a backup and recovery strategy in line with their goals and operational needs. If the company deals with large volumes of critical information, it will require daily, perhaps hourly, backups to storage servers
### **Disaster Recovery Plan**
- Disrupting communications
- Damaging physical infrastructures
- Halting transportation
- Blocking utilities
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: a detailed process for recoering information or a system in the event of a catastrophic disaster.
  - This plan includes such factors as which files and systems need to have backups and their corresponding frequency and methods along with the strategic location of the storage in a separate physical site that is geographically dispersed
- **Hot Site**: a seperate and fully equipped facility where the company can move immediately after a disaster and resume business
- **Cold Site**: a seperate facility that does not have any computer equipment but is a place where employees can move after a disaster
- **Warm Site**: a seperate facility with computer equipment that requires installation and configuration
- **Disaster Recovery Curve**: charts (1) the cost to the company of the unavailability of information and technology and (2) the cost to the company of recovering from a disaster over time.
### **Business Continuity Plan**
- **Emergency**: a sudden, unexpected event requiring immediate action due to potential threat to health and safety, the environment, or property
- **Emergency Preparedness**: ensures that a company is ready to respond to an emergency in an organized, timely, and effect manner
- **Business Continuity Planning (BCP)**: details how a company recovers and restores critical business operations and systems after a disaster or extended disruption
  - BCP contains disaster recovery plans along with many additional plans, including prioritizing business impact analysis, emergency notification plans, and technology recovery strategies.
- **Business Impact Analysis**: identifies all critical business functions and the effect that a specific disaster may have on them. A business impact analysis is primarily used to ensure that a company has made the right decisions about the order of recovery priorities and strategies
- **Emergency Notification Service**: an infrastructure built for notifying people in the event of an emergency
- **Technology Failure**: occurs when the ability of a company to operate is impaired because of a hardware, software, or data outage
- **Incidents**: unplanned interruption of a service
- **Incident Record**: contains all of the details of an incident
- **Incident Management**: the process responsible for managing how incidents are identified and corrected
- **Technology Recovery Strategies**: focus specifically on prioritizing the order for restoring hardware, software, and data across the organization that best meets business recovery requirements
  - Details the order of importance for recovering hardware, software, data centers, and networking (or connectivity)
## **Supporting Change: Agile MIS Infrastructure**
- **Agile MIS Infrastructure**: includes the hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment that, when combined, provides the underlying foundation to support the organization's goals
- **Agile MIS Infrastructure Characterisitics**:
  - **Accessibility**: refers to the varying levels that define what a user can access, view, or perform when operating a system
    - **Administrator Access**: unrestricted access to the entire system
      - Can perform functions such as resetting passwords, deleting accounts, and shutting down entire systems
    - **Web Accessibility**: means that people with disabilities, can use the web
    - **Web Sccessibility Initative (WAI)**: brings together people form industry, disability organizations, government, and research labs from around the world develop guidelines and resources to help make the web accessible to people with disabilities, including auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.
  - **Availability**: refers to the time frames when the system is operational
    - **Unavailable**: when a system is not operating and cannot be used
    - **High Availability**: occurs when a system is continuously operational at all times
  - **Maintainability (or Flexibility)**: refers to how quickly a system can transform to support environmental changes
    - Helps to measure how quickly and effectively a system can be changed or repaired after a failure
  - **Portability**: refers to the ability of an application to operate on different devices or software platforms, such as different operating systems
  - **Reliability (or Accuracy)**: ensures that a system is functioning correctly and providing accurate information
    - **Vulnerability**: a system weakness, such as a password that is never changed or a system left on while an employee goes to lunch, that can be exploited by a threat
  - **Scalability**: describes how well a system can scale up, or adapt to the increased demands of growth
    - **Performance**: measures how quickly a system performs a process or transaction. Performance is a key component of scalability as systems that can't scale suffer from performance issues
    - **Capacity**: represents the maximum throughput a system can deliver; for example, the capacity of a hard drive represents its size or volume
    - **Capacity Planning**: determines future environmental infrastructure requirements to ensure high-quality system performance
  - **Usability**: the degree to which a system is easy to learn and efficient and satisying to use
    - **Serviceability**: how quickly a third party can change a system to ensure it meets user needs and the terms of any contracts, including agreed levels of reliability, maintainability, or availability
## **MIS and the Environment**
- **Sustainable, or green, MIS**: describes the production, management, use, and disposal of technology in a way that minimizes damage to the environment
- **Corporate Social Responsibility**: companies' acknowledged responsibility to society
- **Clean Computing**: a subset of sustainable MIS, refers to the environmentally responsible use, manufacture, and disposal of technology products and computer equipment
- **Green Personal Computer (green PC)**: built using environment-friendly materials and designed to save energy
### **Increased Electronic Waste**
- **Ewaste**: discarded, obsolete, or broken electronic devices
  - Includes CDs, DVDs, thumb drives, printer cartriges, cell phones, iPods, external hard drives, TVs, VCRs, DVD players, microwaves, and so on
- **Upcycle**: reuses or refurbishes eqatse and creates new product

### **Increased Energy Consumption**
- **Energy Consumption**: the amount of energy consumed by business processes and systems
### **Increased Carbon Emissions**
- **Carbon Emissions**: including the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide produced by business processes and systems
### **Supporting the Environment: Sustainable MIS Infrastructure**
- **Grid Computing**: a collection of computers, often geographically dispersed, that are coordinated to solve a common problem
  - With grid computing, a problem is broken into pieces and distributed to many machines, allowing faster processing than could occur with a single system
- **Smart Grid**: delivers electricity using two-way digital technology
  - It is meant to solve the problem of the world's outdated electrical grid, making it more efficient and reliable by adding the ability to monitor, analyze, and control the transmission of power remotely.
- **Virtualization**: creates multiple virtual machines on a single computing device
  - Virtualization is essentially a form of consolidation that can benefit sustainable MIS infrastructures in a variety of ways, for example:
    - By increasing availability of applications that can give a higher level of performance, depending on the hardware used
    - By increasing energy efficiency by requiring less hardware to run multiple systems or applications
    - By increasing hardware usability by running multiple operating systems on a single computer.
  - **Storage Virtualization**: combines multiple network storage devices so they appear to be a single storage device
  - **Network Virtualization**: combines networks by splitting the available bandwidth into independent channels that can be assigned in real time to a specific device
  - **Server Virtualization**: combines the physical resources, such as servers, processors, and operating systems, from the applications
    - This is the most common form and typically when you hear the term virtualization, you can assume server virtualization.
- **Data Center**: a facility used to house management information systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems
- **Cloud Computing**: stores, manages, and processes data and applications over the Internet rather than on a personal computer, or server
- **Multi-Tenancy**: in the cloud means that a single instance of a system serves multiple customers
  -  Multi-tenancy helps reduce operational costs associated with implementing large systems because the costs are dispersed across many tenants
-  **Single-Tenancy**: each customer or tenant must purchase and maintain an individual system
-  **Cloud Fabric**: the software that makes possible the benefits of cloud computing, such as multi-tenancy
-  **Cloud Fabric Controller**: an individual who monitors and provisions cloud resources, similar to a server administrator at an individual company
-  The cloud offers a company higher availability, greater reliability, and improved accessibility—all with affordable high-speed access. For flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, cloud computing is quickly becoming a viable option for companies of all sizes
-  **Utility Computing**: offers a pay-per-use revenue model similar to a metered service such as gas or electricity
-  **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: delivers hardware networking capabilities, including the use of servers, networking, and storage, over the cloud using a pay-per-use revenue model
-  **Dynamic Scaling**: the MIS infrastructure can be automatically scaled up or down based on requirements

-  **Public Cloud**: promotes massive, global, and industrywide applications offered to the general public
-  **Private Cloud**: serves only one customer or organization and can be located on the customer's premises or off the customer's premises
-  **Community Cloud**: serves a specific community with common business models, security requirements, and compliance considerations
-  **Hybrid Cloud**: includes two or more private, public, or community clouds, but each cloud remains seperate and is only linked by technology that enables data and application portability
-  **Cloud Bursting**: when a company uses its own computing infrastructure for normal usage and accesses the cloud when it needs to scale for peak load requirements, ensuring that a sudden spike in usage does not result in poor performance or system crashes

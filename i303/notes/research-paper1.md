## **Chemistry in Context**
- 4 Gases that Contribute to Air Pollution (pg. 23-24)
  1. Carbon Monoxide (CO)
  - When you inhale CO it passes into your bloodstream and then interferes with the ability of your hemoglobin to carry oxygen.
    - If you breathe CO you may feel dizzy, sick or you may get a headache.
    - Continued exposure can make you extremely ill or kill you.
  - Automobiles & charcoal grills
  2. Ozone ($O_3$)
  - Can reduce your ling function
    - Symptoms include chest pain, coughing, sneezing, or lung congestion
  3. Sulfur Dioxide ($SO_2$)
  - If you inhale sulfur dioxide, it dissolves in the moist tissue of your lungs to form an acid. The elderly, the young, and individuals with emphysema or asthma are most susceptible to sulfur dioxide poisoning.
  - Burning of coal
  4. Nitrogen Dioxide ($NO_2$)
  - Like sulfur dioxide, it can combine with the moist tissue in your lungs to produce an acid.
  - Produced from Nitrogen monoxide
    - Nitrogen monoxide produced by anything hot, including vehicle engines and coal-fired power plants
Particulate Matter (PM)
- These particles, when inhaled, go deep into your lungs, irritating them. The smallest particles pass from your lungs into your bloodstream and can cause heart disease.
- Classified by size
- Orginates from vehicle engines, coal-burning power plants, wildfires, and blowing dust

## **How Trump is redefining the EPA**
- [X] **What is the EPA's mission?**
- Created in 1970 by President Richard Nixon
- EPA Responsibility: protect American's health and environment
- [X] **What is Trmup's view of the EPA?**
- Throughout 2016 campaign Trump decried the EPA as "job-killing bureaucracy that had needlessly hamstrung the American economy with costly regulations"
  - He vowed to "get rid of it in almost every form"
  - Stacked the EPA with senior leaders who openly are hostile to the agency's original mission
- Matt Gertz
  - 1 of 4 Rep. congressmen who sponsored a 2017 bill to abolish the EPA
- Scott Pruitt - 1st EPA Administrator
  - Sued the EPA 14 times as OK's attorney general on behalf of the state's oil industry
- Andrew Wheeler - 2nd EPA Administrator
  - Former energy industry lobbyist and lawyer
- EPA's senior deputy general counsel
  - Worked at American Petroleum Institute
- [ ] **What has this new EPA done?**
- Abolished 47 environmental regulations and in process of rolling back 31 more.
- Harvard Law School found such rollbacks could lead to at least 80,000 deaths per decade and cause respiratory problems for more than a million people
- To reserve the ongoing decline of the coal industry, **Scott Pruitt** killed a 2015 rule banning coal-fired electricity plants from dumping 1.4 billion pounds a year of toxic wastewater into rivers, streams, contaminating them with mercury, selenium, and arsenic.
  - Linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders
- Oil & gas companies are no longer required to inform the EPA about their methane emissions, or leaks
  - These companies emit 13 million metric tons of greenhouse gas annually
- EPA also lifted key controls mandating that major factories use the best technology available to reduce air polluants, including cancer causing benzene, dioxin, and lead
- [ ] **What about carbon emissions?**
- Removed **climate change** from EPA's website and  prohibited their scientists from particpating in climate change conferences
- Proposed to freeze fuel efficiency standards for cars, SUVs and light trucks at 37 miles per gallon after 2021
  - Estimated to more than triple the amount of carbon dioxide that American cars pump into the atmosphere by 2025
- EPA has moved to hobble the Clean Power Plan, which sought to lower carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. coal-fired power plants by 32 percent by 2030.
  - The proposed replacement plan woud reduce emissions by only 1 percent
- [ ] **What about enforement of laws?**
- [ ] **Shrinking the EPA**
- During Trump's first 18 months in office, 1,600 EPA workers left the agency, while fewer 400 were fired

- [ ] EPA to Disband Air Pollution Review Panel
- [ ] EPA Repeals Obama-Era Methane Rules
- [X] **Trump EPA Unveils Plan to Nullify Federal Rules on Coal Power Plants**
- Trump as a candidate promised to weaken air pollution rules on coal-fired power plants
- He expressed in a speech the EPA's plan to reverse Obama administration rules designed to curtail coal emissions of carbon dixiode and methane that contribute to climate change
- Trump administration new plan - Affordable Clean Energy rule: dismantles Obama's federal rules over all American coal plants and gives regulating authority to each state
- **Despite legal challenges to the Obama plan, known as Clean Power Plan, coal plants have declined in recent years. Since 2010, more than 200 American coal plants have been retured or taken offline.**
- Other energy sources including renewables like wind and solar have become more cost-effective and reliable
- Trump's rules are likely to most affect aging coal plants across the country that polute the most, making them more cost effective to run longer
- **U.S. is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases**
- Clean Power Plan intended to cut U.S. emissions 32 percent below 2005 by 2030
- **Trump plan is only expected to cut emission as much as 1.5 percent**
- [X] Trump Announces Plan to Weaken Obama-Era Fuel Economy Rules
- Obama rules were intended to limit vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change
- Vehicle emissions standards (one of signature policies by Obama administration to confront climate change).
  - **Required light cars made after 2012 to become almost twice as efficient by 2025 - averaging 54 miles per gallon**
- **Trump administration proposal would halt the mileage targets at 34 miles per gallon by 2021**
- DOT & EPA officials cited passenger safety as their primary objective in rolling back the rules. People who owned more efficient cars would drive more, they said, putting them at greater risk of accidents. They also said that cars with better mileage would delay people from getting new cars with enhanced features.

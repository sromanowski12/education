## **Appendix A: Hardware & Software Basics**

### **Introduction**

- **Hardware**: consists of the physical devices associated with a computer system.
- **Software**: the set of instructions that hardware executes to carry out specific tasks.

### **Hardware Basics**

- **Computer**: an electronic device operatings under the control of instructions stored in its own memory that can accept, manipulate, and store data.
- **Hardware & Software Overview**

  - **Hardware**
    - Central Processing
      - CPU: the computer's brain
      - RAM: integrated circuits, works with the CPU
    - Input Device
      - Keyboards, mouse, scanner
    - Output Device
      - Monitor, printer, headphones
    - Storage Device
      - DVD, memory stick, hard drive
    - Communication Device
      - Modem, wireless card
    - Connecting Device
      - Cables, USB port
  - **Software**
    - System SOftware: controls how the various tools work together with application software
      - Operating System Software
        - Windows, Mac OS, Linux
      - Utility SOftware
        - Antivirus, screen savers, data recovery
    - Application Software: performs specific information processing needs
      - Word Processing Software
        - Microsoft Word
      - Spreadsheet Software
        - Microsoft Excel

- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: the actual hardware that interprets and executes the program (software) instructions and coordinates how all other hardware devices work together.
  - Contains two primary parts:

1. **Control Unit** interprets software instructions and literally tells the other hardware devices what to do, based on the software instructions.
2. **Arithmetic-Logic-Unit (ALU)**: performs all arthimetic operations and all logic operations (such as sorting and comparing numbers).

- **Megahertz (MHz)**: the number of millions of CPU cycles per second
- **Gigahertx (GHz)**: the number of billions of CPU cycles per second
- **Complex Instruction Set Computer Chips (CISC)**
- **Reduced Instruction Set Computer Chips (RISC)**
- **Random Access Memory (RAM)**

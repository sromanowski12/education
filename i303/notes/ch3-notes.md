### **DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY**
#### **Disruptive vs. Sustaining Technology**
- **Digital Darwinism**: implies that organizations that cannot adapt to the new demands placed on them for surviving in the information age are doomed to extinction.
- **Disruptive Technology**: a new way of doing things that initially does not meet the needs of existing customers. Disruptive technologies tend to open new markets and destroy old ones.
- **Sustaining Technology**: produces an improved product customers are eager to buy, such as a faster car or larger hard drive. Sustaining technologies tend to provide us with better, faster, and cheaper products in established markets. Incumbent companies most often lead sustaining technology to market, but they virtually never lead in markets opened by disruptive technologies
#### **The Internet and World Wide Web — The Ultimate Business Disruptors**
- **Internet**: a massive network that connects computers all over the world and allows them to communicate with one another. Computers connected via the Internet can send and receive information, including text, graphics, voice, video, and software

#### **Opening New Markets**
- **Mass Customization**: the ability of an organization to tailor its products or services to the customers' specifications
- **Personalization**: occurs when a company knows enough about a customer's likes and dislikes that it can fashion offers more likely to appeal to that person, say by tailoring its website to individuals or groups based on profile information, demographics, or prior transactions.
#### **Reducing Cost** 
- Chris Anderson, editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, describes niche-market ebusiness strategies as capturing the **long tail**, referring to the tail of a typical sales curve

- **Business-to-business (B2B)** applies to businesses buying from and selling to each other over the Internet. Examples include medical billing service, software sales and licensing, and virtual assistant businesses.

#### **Consumer-to-Business (C2B)**
- **Consumer-to-business (C2B)** applies to any consumer who sells a product or service to a business on the Internet. One example is customers of Priceline.com, who set their own prices for items such as airline tickets or hotel rooms and wait for a seller to decide whether to supply them. 
#### **Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)**
- **Consumer-to-consumer (C2C)** applies to customers offering goods and services to each other on the Internet. A good example of a C2C is an auction where buyers and sellers solicit consecutive bids from each other and prices are determined dynamically.

Read the material on Disruptive Innovation (1-3 of the material provided in the module) the remained material should assist with a deeper understanding of the influence of early adopters and the phases of scientific revolution. Chose a product/service that was an Disruptive Innovation, explain why and the different aspects of Christensen's Model applies in 1-2 pages. 

Disruptive Innovation is the transformation of something expensive to something affordable.  Not all innovations are disruptive even if they are breakthrough.  

A Disruptive Innovation must have 3 components 

1. Must contain an enabling technology 
2. Innovative business model 
3. Coherent value network 

An enabling technology is an invention or innovation, that can be applied to drive radical change in the capabilities of a user or culture. Enabling technologies are characterized by rapid development of subsequent derivative technologies, often in diverse fields.

Coherent Value Network. A network in which suppliers, partners, distributors, and customers are each better off when the disruptive technology prospers.

Netflix
- launched in 1997
- initial service wasn't appealing to most of Blockbuster's customers, who rented movies (typically new releases) on impulse.
- exclusively online interface and a large inventory of movies
  - but delivery through the U.S. mail meant selections took serveral days to arrive
  - appealed to only a few customer groups:
    - movie buffs who didn't care about new releases
    - early adopters of DVD players
    - online shoppers
- Blockbuster initially ignored Netflix
- new technologies allowed Netflix to shift to streaming video over the Internet
- became more appealing to Blockbuster's core customers
  - offering a wider selection of content
  - all-you-can-watch
  - on-demand
  - low-price
  - high quality
  - highly convienent

[What is Disruptive Innovation?](https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation)
- Christensen

- Disruptive innovations orginate in low-end or new-market footholds
- Disruptive innovations don't catch on with mainstream customers until quality catches up to their standards
- Why Getting It Right Matters
  1. Disruption is a process
- Disrupters tend to focus on getting the business model, rather than merely the product, just right. When they succeed, their movement from the fringe (the low end of the market or a new market) to the mainstream erodes first the incumbents' market share and then their profitability.  .
  2. Disrupters often build business models that are very different from those of incumbents
  3. Some disruptive innovation succeed; some don't
  4. The mantra "Disrupt or be disrupted" can misguide us
- What a Disruptive Innovation Lens Can Reveal
- How Our Thinking About Disruption Has Developed
- Making sense of annomolies

[Disruptive Innovation](https://www.christenseninstitute.org/disruptive-innovations/)
Disruptive Innovation describes a process by which a product or service initially takes root in simple applications at the bottom of a market—typically by being less expensive and more accessible—and then relentlessly moves upmarket, eventually displacing established competitors.

Disruptive Innovations are NOT breakthrough technologies that make good products better; rather they are innovations that make products and services more accessible and affordable, thereby making them available to a larger population.

What makes a successful Disruptive Innovation?
- Enabling Technology: An invention or innovation that makes a product more affordable and accessible to a wider popultation
- Innovative Business Model: A business model that targets nonconsumers (new customers who previously did nt buy products or services in a given market) or low-end consumers (the least profitable customers).
- Coherent Value Network: A network in which suppliers, partners, distributors, and customers are each better off when the disruptive technology prospers.

Why it Matters
- Disruptive Innovations have the potential to be an incredibly positive force in the world. Our work at the Christensen Institute has shown that the principles of disruption can be beneficial to areas across society, including healthcare, education, and economic growth.

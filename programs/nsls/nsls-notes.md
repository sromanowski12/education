4. Success Networking Teams
Students are assigned to small groups and meet bi-weekly to set goals for future success. Members hold each other accountable using a highly specialized formula proven to produce results. After each meeting, students submit a reflective journal entry online, providing advisors the opportunity to coach and mentor in a format which actively engages students.


5. Induction
This is the final step towards induction. Most campuses hold a formal induction ceremony which can be shared with family and friends. At this ceremony, students are presented with their Certificate of Leadership Training honoring their achievement and lifetime membership in the NSLS.

Once members have completed the steps above, they will be formally inducted as a full member. After completing the steps towards induction, you will receive post-induction benefits including Certificate of Leadership Training, NSLS Insignia Pin, and Sigma Alpha Pi T-Shirt awarded to you at your chapter's induction ceremony.
